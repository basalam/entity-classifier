# Entity Classifier
A project for dear interns on classifying entities for BSLM products

## How to work?
- The goal of this project is to classify entities with the highest possible accuracy. First, download the data as described in the `load_dataset.py` file. If you need a GPU for experiments, you can use Google Colab and Kaggle.

- After developing and evaluating the model, you need to perform two tasks: 
  - first, push the model to your Hugging Face account. 
  - Second, write a Python script that loads the model and evaluates it on a test dataset that you created from the training dataset. Finally, submit this script by opening a pull request on this repository.

- If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on Telegram @esmln

Good Luck
